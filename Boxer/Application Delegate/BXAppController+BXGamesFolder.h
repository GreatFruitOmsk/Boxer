//The path where we store Boxer's games, stored internally as an alias to allow the folder to be moved.
//Will be nil if no path has been chosen, or the alias could not be resolved.
//IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: this will detect and import an older games folder from Boxer 0.8x automatically.

//The icon of the games folder path. This is used for UIs that need to display the games folder.
@property (readonly, nonatomic) NSImage *gamesFolderIcon;

//The game folder path from 0.8x versions of Boxer (stored as an alias at ~/Library/Preferences/Boxer/Default Folder).
//Will be nil if no path was stored by an older version of Boxer, or if the alias could not be resolved.
@property (readonly, nonatomic) NSURL *legacyGamesFolderURL;

//The 'emergency' path at which to store new gameboxes, used when the games folder cannot be found
//and we don't have the chance to ask the user for a new one. This is currently set to the user's Desktop.
@property (readonly, nonatomic) NSURL *fallbackGamesFolderURL;

//Whether to apply our fancy games-shelf appearance to the games folder each time we open it.
//Setting this to NO will immediately remove all effects from the games folder.
//The value for this property is persisted in user defaults.

//(This does not check if the folder actually exists.)

//If createIfMissing is YES, the folder and all its intermediate folders will be created

//and an error will be given.
